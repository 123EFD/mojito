# Cocktail Hover Cards Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented beautiful hover cards for the Cocktails section of your Mojito website. These cards reveal dynamic content (ingredients and preparation details) when clicked, with smooth animations powered by GSAP.

## Components Created
1. **CocktailCard.jsx** - A reusable component that displays cocktail information and reveals details on interaction
2. **Enhanced Data Structure** - Updated cocktail data in `constants/index.js` to include ingredients and preparation details

## Features Implemented
- **3D Flip Animation**: Cards flip to reveal detailed content when clicked
- **Entrance Animation**: Cards animate in when first loaded
- **Staggered Content Reveal**: Ingredients appear with a staggered animation for visual appeal
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
- **Touch Device Support**: Visual feedback for touch interactions
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support and proper ARIA attributes

## Technical Details
- **GSAP Animations**: Used for all animations including entrance, flip, and content reveal
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling with custom utilities for 3D transformations
- **React Hooks**: useState for flip state management, useRef for DOM access, useGSAP for animations
- **Performance Optimized**: Animations scoped to individual cards to prevent conflicts

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/CocktailCard.jsx` - Created new component
2. `src/components/Cocktails.jsx` - Updated to use CocktailCard components
3. `constants/index.js` - Enhanced cocktail data with ingredients and preparation details
4. `src/index.css` - Added card styles and custom utilities

## How It Works
1. Each cocktail is displayed as a card with basic information (name, origin, price)
2. When a user clicks on a card, it flips to reveal detailed content:
   - Ingredients list with staggered animation
   - Preparation instructions
3. Clicking again flips the card back to show basic information
4. Cards also respond to keyboard interactions (Enter/Space keys)

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile: 1 card per row
- Tablet/small screens: 2 cards per row
- Desktop: 3 cards per row
- Card height adjusts for different screen sizes

## Animation Details
- **Entrance**: Fade in with upward movement
- **Interaction**: Subtle bounce effect when clicked
- **Flip**: Smooth 3D rotation transition
- **Content Reveal**: Staggered animations for list items and text

## Accessibility Features
- Cards are focusable with tabIndex={0}
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for readability
